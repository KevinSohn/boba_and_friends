In order to start using this app, access the GitHub using the link submitted to the main project. Clone the repository into your local computer or device. Instructions on how to clone a repository are here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository. Once you have the repository, open your terminal and use the cd command to enter into the main folder "boba_and_friends". 

From there, run "npm add expo" in your terminal to add the expo dependency to the project, a requisite in order to run the development server of this app. Make sure you have "node" installed on your computer to be able to run "npm" and "npx" commands. You can install node from this website here: https://nodejs.org/en/download.

Once you have downloaded the expo dependency and node_modules on your computer, you can use the command "npx expo start" to run the app. This command should start a server automatically, and will keep it running until you tell it to stop by entering the command "CRL + C". In your terminal, a QR code should appear, as well as some commands like "Press i | open iOS simulator" underneath the QR code. 

From here, to run the app on your iPhone, please download the app Expo Go from the App Store. From there, all you need to do is scan the QR code with your iPhone's camera, and the project should open up inside the Expo Go app automatically.

Unfortunately, at this time, the other methods of opening this project are not supported, like Android or web. As such, while you can attempt to open it through those methods by pressing "a" or "w" while the server is open, most likely only the user interface will load and key underlying features will not able to function.

From there, using this app on your iphone should be relatively straight-forward. You type the name of a drink or a shop into the search bar, and the app will return a list of shops with some information about each one of them. If you click on a list item, it will return a page where you can see the hours, call the shop, and access their page where you can order food. You can also like the shop, where it will show up on your page the number of shops you liked.
